## Build from Source
### Linux
If you run Linux, you can use the Makefile to build the binaries. Since the source is based on .NET Core you have to install the [.NET Core SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux). To build the binaries of the library and the console program for windows and linux use the following commands. To build platform specific binaries use the targets provided in the Makefile.

```bash
make
```

### Windows
To build the binaries on windows, the [.NET Core SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows) is needed too. Run the following command in the `src` subdirectory of the project (library or console program) you want to build.:

```bat
dotnet build
```

## Configuration File
To prevent entering the credentials and the host each time, the data can be provided through a user specific configuration file.

Properties not maintained in the file will be requested by CloudCopy during invocation. The command line options `--Hostname` and `--Username` override the data maintained.

You can either create the file manually or using the the `configure` command of CloudCopy.

### Create it manually
The configuration file allows you to maintain the following properties:

* `Hostname` only, or
* `Hostname` and `Username`, or
* `Hostname` and `Username` and `Password` (**not recommended**).

Example file:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<CloudCopy>
	<Hostname>my000000.crm.ondemand.com</Hostname>
	<Username>username</Username>
	<Password>password</Password>
</CloudCopy>
```

Depending on your operating system the file must by created at the following path:

Windows:
```
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\CloudCopy\default.xml
```

Debian / Ubuntu:
```
~/.local/share/CloudCopy/default.xml
```

### Create it using CloudCOpy

If you are migrating from CloudCopy `0.4` to `0.5` (Windows only) and you are already using a configuration file with a clear text password maintained, you can easily encrypt the password using the follwoing command:

```bat
CloudCopy configure
```

To create a new configuration file use the following command and replace the Tokens `<hostname>` and `<username>`.

```
CloudCopy configure -H <hostname> -U <username> -M
```

If you use the option `-M` CloudCopy promptes you to type the password. You cannot pass it directly using a parameter!

**ATTENTION**: Passwords are only encrypted on Windows machines!

### Security considerations
On Linux systems maintain the recommended file permissions to prevent other users from reading your password
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.local/share/CloudCopy/default.xml
```

## C4C User Configuration
CloudCopy uses the OData service provided by C4C. To access it, an application user or a technical (aka integration) user is needed.

### Creating a technical user
1) Create a `Communication Systems` (Administrator \ General Settings \ Integration \ Communication Systems)
2) Define a `Communication Arrangements` (Administrator \ General Settings \ Integration \ Communication Arrangements)
   - use communication scenario `OData Services for Business Objects`
   - use `Basic Authentication` as authentication method
   - specify a password (username is preset by C4C)
   - assign the required OData services
  

## LibCloudCopy
With release `0.5` CloudCopy is split in a reusable library and the command line client.
