## Installing
### Linux
To install CloudCopy use, the following commands. To run it, use `./CloudCopy`.

```bash
$ mkdir CloudCopy && cd CloudCopy
$ curl -LsS https://github.com/AndreasFerdinand/CloudCopy/releases/download/v0.4/CloudCopy-0.4-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar xzv
```

### Windows
Just download and extract the file `CloudCopy-0.4-win-x64.zip` from the the release-page and use the executable `CloudCopy.exe`.

## Build from Source
### Linux
If you run Linux, you can use the Makefile to build the binaries. Since the source is based on .NET Core you have to install the [.NET Core SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux). Additionally you need to create the `Version`-file in the root directory which has to include the version number of your build. To build the binaries for windows and linux use the following two commands. To build platform specific binaries you can use the target 'windows' or 'linux' for the make command.

```bash
echo "v.1.2.3.4" > Version
make
```

### Windows
To build the binaries on windows, the [.NET Code SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows) is needed too. First you have to create the `VersionName`-file in the root directory which has to contain the version number. Afterwards navigate to the `src` directory and use the following command to build the binaries for windows:

```bat
dotnet build
```

## Configuration File
To prevent entering the credentials and the host each time, the data can be provided through a user specific configuration file.

### Path to the File
Debian / Ubuntu:
```
~/.local/share/CloudCopy/default.xml
```

Windows:
```
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\CloudCopy\default.xml
```

### Format
It is not recommended to use the file, since the credentials are stored unencrypted in it. At least be sure, to prevent other users to access the file by setting appropriate file permissions.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<CloudCopy>
	<Hostname>my000000.crm.ondemand.com</Hostname>
	<Username>username</Username>
	<Password>password</Password>
</CloudCopy>
```

### Set recommended file permissions (linux)
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.local/share/CloudCopy/default.xml
```

## C4C User Configuration
CloudCopy uses the OData service provided by C4C. To access it, an application user or a technical (aka integration) user is needed.

### Creating a technical user
1) Create a `Communication Systems` (Administrator \ General Settings \ Integration \ Communication Systems)
2) Define a `Communication Arrangements` (Administrator \ General Settings \ Integration \ Communication Arrangements)
   - use communication scenario `OData Services for Business Objects`
   - use `Basic Authentication` as authentication method
   - specify a password (username is preset by C4C)
   - assign the required OData services
